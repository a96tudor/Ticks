 *
 *    Exercise:   We have seen several examples of producer-consumer implemented using a
 *       number of different synchronisation primitives in pseudo-code.
 *       Implement a ProducerConsumer class using synchronized, wait(), and
 *       notify() in Java, and use it to pass a sequence of integer values from
 *       one thread (the producer) to a second that prints them (the consumer).
