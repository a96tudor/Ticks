/**
 * PartA.java
 *
 *    Exercise:    Write a short program in which two threads both increment a shared
 *           integer repeatedly, without proper synchronisation, 1,000,000 times,
 *           printing the resulting value at the end of the program.  Run the program
 *           on a multicore system and attempt to exercise the potential race in the
 *           program.
